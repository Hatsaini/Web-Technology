# COMP2110 Week 02: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This week's workshop focused on building a foundational understanding of web development using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

### Tasks Completed:

*   **HTML Structure (`index.html`):** Developed a basic personal website featuring:
    *   A table detailing student history.
    *   A descriptive section about myself.
    *   Inclusion of images and videos using appropriate HTML tags.
    *   Utilization of semantic HTML elements such as `<header>` and `<footer>` for better document structure and accessibility.

*   **CSS Styling (`style.css`):** Applied CSS to enhance the visual presentation of the webpage, including:
    *   Customizing colors and fonts.
    *   Implementing a 3-grid layout to organize content effectively.

*   **JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`):** Implemented interactive features, specifically:
    *   A button to toggle between light and dark themes for the page.
    *   A button to dynamically swap embedded images on the page.
